// Generally, for D8.6+, x.y is in security support until x.y+2 is out:
// "Security fixes are provided until the following minor release, approximately
// six additional months (so each minor receives security coverage for one year
// in total and two minors receive security coverage at a time)."

// The first release to officially have security coverage for one year was 8.6.x.
// 8.5.x has unofficial extended security coverage for several SAs, but did not receive
// a backport of a Symfony issue.
// 8.4.x and earlier were strictly 7 months (six months full support plus one month
// where we would not disclose vulnerabilities in the branch without a backport).
